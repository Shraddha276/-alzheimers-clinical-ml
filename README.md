This project implements a clinical machine learning pipeline to classify

Alzheimer’s disease using demographic and cognitive assessment variables

from the OASIS-1 dataset.



Features

- Clinical variable selection (Age, Education, MMSE)

- Missing value handling

- Binary diagnosis labeling using CDR

- Logistic regression model

- Model evaluation using accuracy



Data

Data were provided in part by the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1).

Raw data are not included due to data use restrictions.
